# How to build
NOTE #1: This repository does NOT includes a c/c++ compiler and make.

1. In your terminal, navigate through the ewindows folder and type "make". The output should be:
  make[1]: Entering directory \`C:/blah/blah/Ewindows/src'
  make[1]: Leaving directory \`C:/blah/blah/Ewindows/src'
2. Type ewindows and you are set to use!

NOTE #2: If you don't use mingw, you can change "gcc" in C:/blah/blah/Ewindows/src/Makefile to any c++ compiler you have, for example: zapcc, cl, clang, etc...
